# coding-quiz
 This week I had to code, from scratch, a quiz for a user.

 When you click on the start button, the timer starts counting down to zero.

 You are presented with the first question and series of choices to select the correct answer. If you select the wrong answer, ten second are deducted from your time.

 Once you have completed the quiz, your final score is displayed, which is the remaining time you had left. You must enter your initials to store and display your score.
