//============PSEUDOCODE=========//

//AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score

//when the start button is pressed, the timer begins counting down and the first question appears
//when a selection is made, the next question appears, a small message displays whether your selection was correct or wrong
// if a wrong selection is made, ten seconds are deducted from the time 
//when the quiz is over, display ALL DONE and final score as time left and form for initials and high score
//submit initials and high score to storage to display
